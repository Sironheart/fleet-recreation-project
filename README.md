# Recreation project

This project is only used to submit code to Jetbrains for checking problems with specific cases in Fleet. This readme
will give detailed information about how to setup each case.


## autogenerated-files

#### Problem
Autogenerated files are not indexed and given in code completion.

#### Setup
- `gradle generateAvroJava`
- The file `autogenerated-files/src/main/kotlin/autogenerated/files/App.kt` shows in fleet an error
because it can not resolve the autogenerated file. Even after multiple executions of the command,
`gradle clean` executions and different other tries.

#### Files from other sources used
- `autogenerated-files/src/main/avro/webhook/send.avsc` from [Braze](https://github.com/Appboy/currents-examples/blob/master/sample-data/Avro/users.messages.webhook.Send.avro) as extracted schema
